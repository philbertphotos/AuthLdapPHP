Simple LDAP class for PHP is a LDAP authentication and user 
management class for PHP. It provides a mechanism for easily authenticating
users against an LDAP database, as well as extracting information, changing 
passwords and the like. It's not intended to be a full-blown all singing, all 
dancing LDAP access class - rather, it performs a few basic, frequently used 
functions.
